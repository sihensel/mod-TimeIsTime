# mod-TimeIsTime
Simplified version of [mod-TimeIsTime](https://github.com/dunjeon/mod-TimeIsTime) that allows to set a realm time offset without the need to set epoch timestamps.
Now you can change the realm time without having to change your system clock each time you start the server.

Refer to `mod-time_is_time.conf.dist` for all config options.
